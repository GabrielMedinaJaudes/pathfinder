To begin, in the project directory, run:

### npm start

This project built in the React framework, visualizes three common pathfinding algorithms: Dijstkra's Algorithm, Breadth First Search, and Depth First Search. After starting the project, the viewer will be brought with a grid and three buttons that correspond to the different algorithms that begins the visualization. Additionally, the viewer will have the ability to create walls by clicking on any empty node to make more interesting visalizations. 

### The Algorithms

Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): guarantees the shortest path

Breath-first Search (unweighted): guarantees the shortest path

Depth-first Search (unweighted): not optimal for pathfinding, does not guarantee the shortest path

I hope you enjoy!
